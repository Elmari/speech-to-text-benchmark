# Speech-to-Text Benchmark

Benchmark for German language models, based on the [benchmark]((https://github.com/Picovoice/speech-to-text-benchmark)) of [Picovoice](https://picovoice.ai).
 The speechdata-corpus [Tuda-de v2](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/acoustic-models.html) is used as the test data set. 

## Installation and Usage

In order to run this benchmark you have to add the Tuda-de_v2 dataset to the resources/data/german-speechdata-package-v2 directory. Also, you have to add credential information for the commercial ASR-engine you want to use. See engine.py as well as the corresponding descriptions of these systems for more details. Via the --engine_type argument you then have to specifiy the engine you want to use. The following values are supported: 
* AMAZON_TRANSCRIBE
* GOOGLE_SPEECH_TO_TEXT
* AZURE_SPEECH_TO_TEXT
* WATSON_SPEECH_TO_TEXT
* MOZILLA_DEEP_SPEECH_05 (uses the deepspeech 0.5 model by Aashish Agarwal and Torsten Zesch - see [deepspeech_german](https://github.com/AASHISHAG/deepspeech-german))
* MOZILLA_DEEP_SPEECH_06 (uses the deepspeech 0.6 model by Aashish Agarwal and Torsten Zesch - see [deepspeech_german](https://github.com/AASHISHAG/deepspeech-german))
* KALDI_SPEECH_TO_TEXT (uses the model by Milde and KÃ¶hn - see [kaldi-tuda-de](https://github.com/uhh-lt/kaldi-tuda-de))

In order to use the mozilla models, you have to place the resource files under resources/deepspeech05 or resources/deepspeech06) (see engine.py for details)

In order to use the kaldi model, kaldi has to be accessible via the following url: http://localhost:8080/client/dynamic/recognize. This can be achieved by running kaldi via the [kaldi-gstreamer-server](https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server) (see engine.py for details).
